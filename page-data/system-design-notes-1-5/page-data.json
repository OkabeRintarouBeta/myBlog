Comment your answers below along with any queries that you may have.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For a very basic system, we need the following components for sure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Database - Persistence is something that is required for every backend application. So, A Database is utmost necessary</li>\n<li>Server - For any system that needs to scale, we need to have a server, so that we can have an API driven architecture so that if the frontend changes, the new frontend can easily consume the existing API's.</li>\n<li>Network - We need a Network as a component for the communication between the client and the server and between the server and the database.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not necessary</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Components like a frontend are not necessary because even a console will work or even a curl command will work.</li>\n<li>Stuff like Load Balancers, Caches are there for efficient and highly scalable systems, they are not required for basic applications.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Client Server Architecture</h2>\n<h3>Client Type</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>thin client: logic and data on the server(backend) side</li>\n</ol>\n<img src=\"../images/system_design_youtube/client_server_basic.jpg\">\ne.g. streaming platforms like Netflix\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>thick client: logic and data on the client side\n<ul>\n<li>Many operation happening on the client side(e.g. video game)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Structure(2-layer v.s. 3-layer)</h3>\n<img src=\"../images/system_design_youtube/client_server_basic2.jpg\">\n<h3>Quiz</h3>\n<p>List down the real world use cases when you would choose a thick client architecture over thin client architecture and vice versa. List pros and cons in all scenarios. Can you think of a system which has thick client and thin client and multiple tiers? Also, can servers behave as clients?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When I choose thick client over thin client architecture : When a system want to takes care of more computation in the client side and want to relay less on the server side in this scenario we can go for thick client. <br>Example: Ms-Excel, Ms-Paint.</li>\n<li>When I choose thin client over think client architecture: When a system want to takes care of more computation in the server side and making client lite weight in this scenario we can go for thin client.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>Example : Web-browser.\n3. Pros and Cons of thick and thin client:\n- Thick client:\n- Pros :\n- System can perform seamlessly without considering network latency.\n- More cost to maintain.\n-  High responsive to the user\n- Cons:\n- No assurance of data availability as it has possibility of system crash and other difficulties.\n- High cost to maintain the app.\n- Effective usage of system resource is less.\n- Thin client:\n- Pros:\n- Easy to manage/maintain system infrastructure.\n- Highly scalable and easy maintainable app\n- Cost effective\n- Cons:\n- Highly dependent on network connectivity/availability.<br>\n- Each components are managed by component professionals.\n4. Thick client example : Ms-Excel <br>\nThin client example : webserver<br>\nMulti tier example : youtube\n5. Yes, Server can be a client also, because in large enterprise applications not all the apps takes care of computations some may get the other processed/computation result and take care of responsibility to get back to presentation layer.</p>\n<h2>Proxy</h2>\n<p>proxy: on one's behaf</p>\n<h3>Proxy Type</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Forward Proxy\n<ul>\n<li>Client(s) &#x3C;-> Proxy &#x3C;-> Server</li>\n<li>Server doesn't know the IP of the client, just know the proxy's IP</li>\n<li>Can cache the response on proxy side</li>\n<li>Can be used for blocking access to some sites</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reverse Proxy\n<ul>\n<li>Client &#x3C;-> Proxy &#x3C;-> Server(s)</li>\n<li>Client doesn't know the identity of the server, only know the proxy's identity</li>\n<li>Can be used for load balancing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Quiz</h3>\n<h2>Data &#x26; Data Flow</h2>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"Components Overview Logical Entities data,database, applications,cache, message queues, interface...
